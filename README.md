# jazz-choice-task
Demo melody choice task using psychTestR, created for PSY 525 Reproducible Research Methods, Spring 2020

## Getting Started

psychTestR is a new package for creating behavioral experiment interfaces using Shiny, and is quite well-documented at <https://pmcharrison.github.io/psychTestR/>.

Features:

* Integrates data collection and analysis in R
* Allows for a clean workflow
* Modular testing approach (easy to read!)
* Can be deployed locally or online (important in 2020)
* Open source for open science!
